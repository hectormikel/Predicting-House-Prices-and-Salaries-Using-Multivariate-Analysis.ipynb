# House Price and Salary Prediction with Multiple Variables
This repository contains Python code for predicting house prices and salaries using multiple variables. The code leverages the polars library for data manipulation and scikit-learn for linear regression modeling.

## The project demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict:

House Prices: Based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and age of the house.
Salaries: Based on experience, test scores, and interview scores.
The code handles missing data by filling null values with appropriate defaults (e.g., median for numerical columns and 'zero' for experience).

## Dependencies
